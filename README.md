## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a **robust, high-resolution SOC map** by integrating:

- 🧭 **Soil Taxonomy information** (specifically, *Soil Series data*)  
- 🛰️ **Land Cover Change maps**  

This integration helps to account for the influence of **recent land cover changes** on **soil carbon stocks**.
